- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up Python in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)

- Excellent!

However,
** Please, if the repo is public, remove your labs; I don't want other students
   being able to use your code to cheat in the assignments. The submission site
   will always keep a copy for you anyway.

- The evidence of setting up the java compiler (javac) is missing, which is a
  really big deal. Please make sure you have that correctly installed and
  setup. Please come to see me if you need help.

- The repository is not organized as indicated in the handout, i.e., you were
  asked to organize your work and put your homework assignment in a folder
  named hw/0/ but you did not follow instructions.

- You were asked to name your .pdf file hw0lastname.pdf where "lastname" is
  your last name, but you did not follow instructions.

- The link to your GitHub repository was nowhere to be found in your document
  or screenshots. 

- Please be careful in following instructions in the future.

- Although the assignment is in the specified folder, the repository in general
  is not properly organized and is confusing.

- Please organize your GitHub repository immediately.

- A little header or cover page with your name, class, assignment, date, etc.
  is always good to have in any assignment of this type.

- You did not bring the assignment in printed version by the deadline.

- It appears that there are several branches in your repository. Please delete
  them. Preserve only ONE branch, the -master- branch.

- Please staple all your assignments as necessary.

- You must submit your assignments on time.

- It seems like you deleted homework 0 in your second commit. Why? Please leave
  all past assignments in your repository! Put the homework back in there in
  your next commit.


Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
